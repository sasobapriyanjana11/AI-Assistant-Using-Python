# AI Desktop Virtual Assistant
ðŸš€ Dive into the world of artificial intelligence with this Python project! I developed  a smart desktop assistant that responds to voice commands and performs tasks with ease. This project demonstrates how to create a smart assistant that responds to voice commands, performs tasks,text-to-speech and integrates a user-friendly graphical interface.

In this project:
- Learn how to create a GUI using Tkinter.
- Integrate voice recognition to interpret user commands.
- Use pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality.
- Build a desktop assistant capable of performing simple tasks like opening applications, fetching weather information, and more.

## Installation

To get started with the AI Desktop Virtual Assistant project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sasobapriyanjana11/AI-Assistant-Using-Python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Python-Virtual-Assistant
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - For Linux/MacOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - For Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the AI Desktop Virtual Assistant, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python3 GUI.py
```

## Features

- Voice Recognition: The assistant listens to your commands and responds accordingly.
- Text-to-Speech: The assistant can speak back to you using pyttsx3.
- Tkinter GUI: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the assistant.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3: The programming language used for this project.
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
- SpeechRecognition: For recognizing voice commands.
- pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.
- pyAudio: For audio input and output.
- os: For performing system-level tasks like opening applications.
